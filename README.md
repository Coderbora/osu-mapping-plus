# osu!mapping plus

**DISCONTINUED:** Original site already has implemented this feature, so this extension will be discontinued. Check out the topic from [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues/5635).

This extension adds subscription feature for users and automatically tracks users mapping activity. It has an inbox to list notifications and subscriptions.

**WARNING:** Do not click too much on subscribe button, you can get rate-limited very easily by spamming requests.
